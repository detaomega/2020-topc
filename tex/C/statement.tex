There are $n$ magical circles on a plane. 
They are centered at $(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$, respectively.
In the beginning, the radius of each circle is $0$. 
The radius of all magical circles will grow at the same rate until 
they touch another magical circle. 
Write a program calculate the total area of the sum of all magical 
circles at the end of growing.
