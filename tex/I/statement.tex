We say a set of points are \emph{concyclic} if they all lie on 
the circumference of a circle.
The task is: given an integer $n$, find a circle centered at $(0,0)$ 
such that there are at least $n$ distinct concyclic integral points lying on it.

Note: Integral points are points with integral coordinates.
