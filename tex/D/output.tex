If there is no way to disrupt the enemy's defense, output $-1$.
Otherwise, output $\frac{n}{2}$ lines.
The $i$-th line describes your $i$-th attack with two integers $p_i$ and $q_i$ 
separated by a blank.
Your $i$-th attack is to take down soldiers $p_i$ and $q_i$.
At that time, they must be adjacent and have different values.
