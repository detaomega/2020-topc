If there is no ideal way, output $-1$ on a line.
Otherwise, output two lines.
The first line contains two integers $x$ and $y$ separated by a blank.
Megumin can safely cast Explosion on the top of the tree at $(x,y)$.
The second line contains two real numbers $c_x$ and $c_y$ 
separated by a blank. 
Megumin should cast Explosion certered at $(c_x,c_y)$ to destroy all the other
trees.
Please note that $c_x$ and $c_y$ may be fractional numbers.
