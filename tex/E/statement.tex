A binary string is a string consisting of only $0$'s and $1$'s. 
Eric's boss, Elsa, gives him a binary string $s$ of length 20.
She asks Eric to modify $s$ into another binary string $t$ within $D$ days.

Eric really hates this task, so Eric never modifies more than one character in 
a day.
However, Eric must show Elsa his daily progress.
That is, Eric must modify some character of the string.
Therefore, the only possible way for Eric is to modify exact one character in 
a day.

It is obviously cheating to modify a character to any character other than $0$ 
and $1$.
Moreover, Elsa has a good memory, so Eric will be caught cheating if 
he modifies the string into the same binary string twice.
That is, before Eric modifies the string into $t$, all modifications result in
unique strings.
For the same reason, Eric cannot modify the string into $s$, the string given by Elsa.

Eric wants to spend as much time as possible. 
He is wondering if he can spend exact $D$ days to modify the string $s$ into $t$.
Please write a program to help Eric.
