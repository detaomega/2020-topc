You must output a requested trajectory in the following format.
The trajectory is represented by $m+1$ lines where $m$ is the number of
steps of the trajectory.
The $i$-th line contains two integers $r_i$ and $c_i$ separated by a blank.
Pac-Man will be in cell $(r_i,c_i)$ after moving $i$ steps along the trajectory.
