Bafuko is a gifted student. Despite being a teenager, 
she is studying advanced algorithms now. 
She just learned about graphs and trees. 
The instructor of the class gave a programming assignment today. 
This task is about recovering the adjacency list of a tree graph $G_T=(V,E)$
from a given undirected graph $G_U=(V,F)$. The properties of $G_T$ and $G_U$ are
listed as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item $G_T$ is a tree graph.
\item $G_T$ and $G_U$ have the same vertex set $V=\{1,\ldots,n\}$.
\item For every vertex $v\in V$, the degree of $v$ in $G_T$ is at most $3$.
\item The edge $\{u,v\}$ belongs to $F$ if and only if the distance between 
      $u$ and $v$ in $G_T$ is either $1$ or $2$.
\end{itemize}

You, as a professional programmer, will like to finish the assignment 
in 20 minutes and brag about how easy it is while 
playing Bafuko's favorite game --- Super Smash Sisters.
Let's see if you can do it!
