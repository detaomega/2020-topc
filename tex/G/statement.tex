There is a rectangle garden in front of Gina's house.
The garden can be seen as an $n$-by-$m$ rectangular grid.
All grid cells are identical squares, and two grid cells are adjacent 
if they share an common edge.

Gina loves cacti and wants to plant as many cacti as possible in the garden.
However, there are some constraints on planting cacti.
\begin{itemize}
\item In some cells, the soil can be too wet and unsuitable for cacti.
Gina cannot plant cacti in those cells.
\item In each cell, Gina may only plant at most one cactus. The soil in the 
garden is not fertile enough to grow two or more cacti in a cell.
\item In any pair of adjacent cells, Gina may only plant at most one cactus.
Otherwise, the cacti in those cell may be harmed by each other's thorn.
\end{itemize}

Please write a program to help Gina generate a plan to plant cacti in the 
garden. Your program must maximize the number of cacti planted in the garden.
