First, output the maximum number of cacti can be planted in the garden on the
first line. Then, output $n$ lines, and each line should contains a string of 
$m$ characters.
These characters must be one of `\verb+.+', `\verb+*+' and `\verb+C+'.
The $j$-th character of the $i$-th of these lines indicates the status of
the grid cell on the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column.
`\verb+C+ means that Gina should plant a cactus in the cell to maximize the
number of cacti planted.
For the other cells, output the character in the corresponding position of the
input.
