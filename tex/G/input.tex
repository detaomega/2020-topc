First line contains a number $T$ indicating the number of test cases. 
For each test case, the first line contains a number $n$ indicating 
the number of vertices in the tree. 
Then $n$ lines follow. 
The $i$-th line descibes the neighbors of $i$ in $G_U$. 
It is started by $c_i$, the numbers of neighbors of $i$, 
then $c_i$ distinct numbers $v_{i,1},\ldots,v_{i,c_i}$ follow, where
$\{i,v_1\},\ldots,\{i,v_{c_i}\}\in F$ are edges in the given graph $G_U$.
