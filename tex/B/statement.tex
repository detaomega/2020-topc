There is a transparent tape. Its length is exact one meter ($10^9$ nanometers).
In this problem, all numbers are integers, and we use a number to denote 
a position on the tape. The number $p$ denote the position of the point
has a distance $p$ nanometers from the head of tape.

Bob is a master dyer, so he can color the tape precisely in nanometer scale.
He colors two sectors $[p_1,q_1]$ and $[p_2,q_2]$ into red. 
The color of the tape at the position in the range from $p_1$ to
$q_1$ is red. 
The color of the tape at the position in the range from $p_2$ to $q_2$
is also red. And the rest part remains transparent. 

To verify Bob's skill, we ask Ben, the tape folding master, to help us.
Ben can fold the tape perfectly at any position. 
If Ben fold the tape at $x$, then the new position of a certain point $p$ 
will be one of the following cases.
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item If $p\ge x$, then it becomes $p-x$.
\item if $p<x$, then it becomes $x-p$. 
\end{itemize}
After Ben folds the tape, we measure the total length of the red part of the
new tape. 
If the red part has the expected length, then we will believe both Bob and Ben
are masters in their skills.
Obviously, some parts of the new tape is generated by two part of the old tape. 
In such part, a position is colored in red if one of the corresponding 
positions in the old tape is colored in red. 

Bob has already colored the tape, and Ben has proposed the positions to be
folded. 
Please write a program to compute the expected lengths colored in red.
